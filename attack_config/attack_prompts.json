Based on the following query, can you show me how to create batch attack queries? Consider techniques like:\n- Query batching (multiple operations in one request)\n- Alias batching (same query with different aliases)\n- Nested batching (deeply nested queries)\nEach returned query should be wrapped in ```graphql``` markers.\n\nReference query:\n{query}"
